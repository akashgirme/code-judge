## Migrations

`npm run migration:generate db/migrations/useful-migration-name`

`npm run migration:run`

## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve api` to start the API development server. Happy coding!
Run `npx nx serve client` to start the CLIENT development server. Happy coding!
Run `npx nx serve code-execution-engine` to start the CODE-EXECUTION-ENGINE development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build api` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

Run `npx nx build client` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

Run `npx nx build code-execution-engine` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).
